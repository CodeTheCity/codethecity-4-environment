# codethecity-4-environment
 
Codethecity is an initiative aiming to improve our cities through highly focussed civic hacking events, bringing coders, designers, community members and service providers together to make a difference.

Our first event happens on 20th/21st June 2015 in Aberdeen and Edinburgh.

Find out more at codethecity.org, on in the wiki here.

If you have any further questions please contact us on twitter @codethecity or email steve@codethecity.org and we'll be delighted to help.
